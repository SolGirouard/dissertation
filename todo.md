# Todo

## General 

 - Modify figures to make them uniform (and get rid of space-saving efforts)
 - Remove instances of "this paper" and replace with "this chapter" or something similar
 - Make notation consistent across the whole document
 - Notation glossary?
 - Go through UIC style requirements


# Resilient colorings

 - Add information from blog post, figures, tables, etc.
 - Put up code on github and link to it? Include in appendix?
