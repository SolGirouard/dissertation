Over the past few decades the internet and social networks became central to
our society.  As a consequence, the study of networks and the algorithmic
complexity of problems about networks are an increasingly important part of the
application of mathematics to practical problems. The content of this
dissertation explores a variety of topics on this theme. First, we explore the
tractibility of computing certain kinds of equilibria for anticoordination
games played on graphs. Next, we study a generic notion of ``resilience'' for
combinatorial search problems, specifically studying the complexity of
resilient graph coloring. Then we turn to the study of MapReduce, a popular
distributed computing framework whose crucial open questions are about its
capacity to solve certain graph problems. Finally, we study a model of disaster
recovery in networks, and prove results about the inability for algorithms to
compute approximate solutions.
