\chapter{Source code listings}
\label{appendix:resilience}

For completeness we provide the source code used in
Chapter~\ref{ch:resilience}. There were three aspects for which a computer
search helped:

\begin{enumerate}
   \item To determine the resilience of famous graphs.
   \item To provide the tables of resilience properties for small graphs,
Table~\ref{table:small-graphs}.
   \item To double-check the resilience properties of the gadgets in
Theorem~\ref{theorem:3-1}.
\end{enumerate}

Note that the computational search for the third item is not necessary, as the
sketch given in the proof of Theorem~\ref{theorem:3-1} can be turned into a
small set of cases to check by hand. However, by providing it here we hope to
reinforce the certainty of the result.

The full source code and datasets used is also available on Github at
